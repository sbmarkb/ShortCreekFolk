## Songs Of My Childhood

### Premise
This reflection and meditation is scheduled for 180 days.

Each day will consist of a morning free writing session, an evening journaling session and, for the first hundred days, I will:
+ listen to songs that played some part of my musical life up to the day I left Tennessee, December 13, 1993
+ research the history of the song, but focus on a particular recording
+ learn to play along
+ post an artist portrait and blog post summarizing each day's study subject

While I was exposed to a diverse genre of music, I will limit my selections to the country, folk, bluegrass and gospel music that featured most prominently during the significant time I spent on my grandparent's farm.

For the next twenty days, I will recreate three of these hundred songs in an original arrangement.

For the final sixty days, I will use the free writing, journaling and other resources to produce at least two original works based on what I've learned.
