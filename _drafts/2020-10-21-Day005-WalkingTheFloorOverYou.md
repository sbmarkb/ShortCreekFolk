> This is day 5 of a 180 day [meditation](../currentmeditation) on songs that defined my youth, specifically those songs associated with time spent in the little country community called Short Creek. The study for the day is "Walking the Floor OVer You."

## The Song
"Walking the Floor Over You" was written by Ernest Tubb and has been called the first honky tonk song. The original recording features "Smitty" Smith on electric guitar.

## Ernest Tubb
The "Texas Troubadour" was a pioneer of country music. His recording career started after he requested an autographed photo from Jimmie Rodgers' widow, which resulted in a friendship that facilitated a recording contract with RCA. "Walking the Floor Over You" sold over a million copies.


## The Anecdote
Papaw thought very highly of Ernest Tubb and played his music for me often.

## The Technique
The melodic electric guitar part is deceivingly difficult. Time is limited today, but the goal is to be able to play this piece with all the staccato greatness of the original.
