## The Present

I live in Santa Barbara, CA. I work as a technical software product manager by day and devote the majority of my remaining hours to my wife and everything that comes with two kids at home in a pandemic. Music remains my happy place -- even more so in sharing the music and stories with my kids.

## The Past
I spent my entire childhood in about a 100 square mile radius of McMinn and Bradley counties in southeastern Tennessee. I left home, travelled the world and ultimately settled on the central coast of California.

## The Future
Could be... Who knows?

## The Story of Short Creek Folk
In a little county in southeast Tennessee, a ways down county road 50, there's a little place called Short Creek. There's farms and trailers, vast fields of hay and tall trees. In my earliest years, it was still dirt and gravel down that way.

In a little green, tin-roofed house, about 2 miles up the road from the Short Creek Baptist Church, lived my Papaw and Nanny, and at the time of my birth, the remainder of their six children, including my Mom. Papaw Joe Ben was the song leader at that little Baptist church from before my birth til he just wasn't able.

There was music in the morning. Music in the evening. And singing all the time. The radio was always on and when it wasn't, there were guitars, banjos, and other such things. I was surrounded by love, music, and the love of music. I wanted for no real need.

A colloquial exaggeration here might go something like: "I was singing before I could walk or talk." Public debut at age 4: "He Did It All For Me" from a recent singing convention, and one my Nanny liked. Papaw and Aunt Judy backed me up.

I spent a lot of time there until the day I left home, and every time I ever went back. Endless vivid, happy memories are still those places - the farm, the church, the rivers and lakes. And the Music.

Today I live in a little town in California. I don't eat a lot of meat. To be succinct, the Tennessee in me is pretty much limited to a few things: decent manners, but a hot temper to go with them, a decent moral compass and an absolute passion for music.
