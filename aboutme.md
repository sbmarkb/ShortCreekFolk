## The Present

I live in Santa Barbara, CA. I work as a technical software product manager by day and devote the majority of my remaining hours to my wife and everything that comes with two kids at home in a pandemic. Music remains my happy place -- even more so in sharing the music and stories with my kids.

## The Past
I spent my entire childhood in about a 100 square mile radius of McMinn and Bradley counties in southeastern Tennessee. I left home, travelled the world and ultimately settled on the central coast of California.

## The Future
Could be... Who knows?
