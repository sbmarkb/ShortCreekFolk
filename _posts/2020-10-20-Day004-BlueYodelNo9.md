> This is day 4 of a 180 day [meditation](../currentmeditation) on songs that defined my youth, specifically those songs associated with time spent in the little country community called Short Creek. The study for the day is "Blue Yodel No. 9 (Standing on the Corner)."

## The Song
"Blue Yodel No. 9 (Standing on the Corner)" is a country blues. As the name suggests, it is the ninth of Jimmie Rodgers "Blue Yodels." The recording features Louis Armstrong on Trumpet and Lil Hardin on piano, though they are not credited due to contracts with another label.

## Jimmie Rodgers
Commonly known as the "Father of Country Music", Jimmie Rodgers is best known for his yodeling. His mother died when he was six, and by thirteen, he was already organizing traveling shows. His first job was as a water boy on the railroad where rail workers and hobos taught him to strum a guitar. He was also exposed to African-American rail worker work chants.

Tuberculosis cost Jimmie the railroad job in 1924 and he was signed to the Victor label in Bristol, Tennessee, in 1927. "Blue Yodel No.9 (Standing on the Corner)" was recorded in July, 1930, in the middle of his short career, which ended in May, 1933, when Jimmie succumbed to the disease.

## The Anecdote
I was able to imitate Jimmie's yodel as a child and it tickled my papaw to no end.

## The Technique
I haven't tried to sing these songs specifically or yodel generally for at least a couple of decades. The goal for today is to just enjoy listening to this song and see if I can eek out a worthy version of my own.
