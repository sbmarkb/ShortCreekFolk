> This is day 7 of a 180 day [meditation](../currentmeditation) on songs that defined my youth, specifically those songs associated with time spent in the little country community called Short Creek. The study for the day is "Sixteen Tons."

## The Song
"Sixteen Tons" was written by Merle Travis about the life of miners in Muhlenberg County, Kentucky. "You load sixteen tons and what do you get? Another day older and deeper in debt," was taken from a letter Merle received from his brother, John. While the Tennessee Ernie Ford version from 1955 is a more popular version, I'm choosing to stick with the original.

## Merle Travis
Merle Travis was born in 1917 in Rosewood, Kentucky. He tended to write about the lives of coal miners, and is most known for his style of fingerpicking. Merle Travis was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970 and the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1977.

## The Anecdote
I have to admit I was aware of Chet Atkins long before I knew who Merle Travis was. Someone noticed my tendancy to use only two fingers of my right hand when fingerpicking and remarked "that's the way Merle Travis played."

## The Technique
Travis picking is one of those things you can learn easily but takes a lot of practice to perfect. The goal for today is to get my thumb dialed in.
