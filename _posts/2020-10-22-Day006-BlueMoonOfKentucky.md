> This is day 6 of a 180 day [meditation](../currentmeditation) on songs that defined my youth, specifically those songs associated with time spent in the little country community called Short Creek. The study for the day is "Blue Moon of Kentucky."

## The Song
"Blue Moon of Kentucky" is a waltz and was written by Bill Monroe in 1945. The official bluegrass song of Kentucky, Bill Monroe's recording was added to the National Recording Registry at the Library of Congress in 2002.

## Bill Monroe
Bill Monroe is the "Father of Bluegrass." As a mandolinist, singer and writer, his career spanned 69 years.

## The Anecdote
In my little corner of the world, bluegrass and country were just one and the same. It wasn't until much later in my life I learned the distinction. The first time I remember hearing this song was as papaw jokingly sang it as we loaded the car for a trip to Ashland, Kentucky, to visit my Aunt Betty Ann. Nanny packed egg sandwiches for us to eat on the way, and we drove in an old Plymouth with checkered fabric on the seats. I left my crayons on the seat and they melted.

## The Technique
I don't play mandolin; it is a great regret. For this study, I will concentrate on Lester Flatt's metronomic timing with the rhythm guitar and try to sing it in the original key. This may require some middle voice as my chest range has diminished over the years.
