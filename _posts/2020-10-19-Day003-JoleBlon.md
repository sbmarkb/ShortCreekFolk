> This is day 3 of a 180 day [meditation](../currentmeditation) on songs that defined my youth, specifically those songs associated with time spent in the little country community called Short Creek. The study for the day is "Jole Blon."

## The Song
Jole Blon (english: Jolie Blonde) is a cajun waltz. The song is often referred to as the "Cajun national anthem." The official fight song of McNeese State University, it was popularized in the 1940's, most notably by Harry Choates' french version.

## Harry Choates
The "Fiddle King of Cajun Swing" and "Godfather of Cajun music" Harry Choates was only with us for 28 years. He got his start playing with Leo Soileau and Leroy Leblanc before forming the Melody Boys in 1946. The recording of "Jole Blon" was a Billboard Top-10 hit, peaking at number 4. Harry had waived his rights to the song and was never compensated for future popular versions. He ultimately died after putting himself in a coma by banging his head against jail cell bars in 1951.

## The Anecdote
My Nanny (maternal grandmother) had a cousin that lived in Lousiana. The cousin had sent Nanny a bottle of wine long before I was born, and the empty bottle was Nanny's rolling pin. My Grandmother Adele (paternal grandmother) introduced me to Cajun and Creole food. I discovered Harry Choates, Cajun music and New Orleans jazz in my pre-teen and teenage years.


## The Technique
My goal is to just be able to play this with the proper waltz swing and sing it in the traditional french.
