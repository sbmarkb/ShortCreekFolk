> This is day 2 of a 180 day [meditation](../currentmeditation) on songs that defined my youth, specifically those songs associated with time spent in the little country community called Short Creek. The study for the day is "Man of Constant Sorrow."

## The Song
"Man of Constant Sorrow," sometimes referred to as "I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow," was originally published by Dick Burnett as "Farewell Song" in 1913. This version by the Stanley Brothers from 1950 popularized the song, but I believe Ralph Stanley was the first to record the song a couple of years earlier.

## The Stanley Brothers
As a kid, I probably thought of The Stanley Brothers even more than Bill Monroe when I thought about what I know now as Bluegrass. Bill Monroe, I've learned, thought too many people might think like that; turns out he didn't like The Stanley Brothers too much. First as a duo called The Lazy Ramblers prior to World War II, The Stanley Brothers were formed after the war accompanied by a band called the Clinch Mountain Boys.

## The Anecdote
Bluegrass and Southern Gospel harmonies are very special to me. There's no real specific anecdote here; just an acknowledgement that I owe exposure early and often to acts like The Stanley Brothers to the development of my ear and ability to anticipate/improvise tight harmonies.

## The Technique
There are newer, popular versions of this song, e.g. Dan Tyminski's version from _O Brother, Where Art Thou?_, so the real challenge for me is not getting distracted and falling into a different form. I've known and sang this song for so long, changing the few things I've noted will be hard as they are nit-picky and don't sound bad the way I phrase things.
