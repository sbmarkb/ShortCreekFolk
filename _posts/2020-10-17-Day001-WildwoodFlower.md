> This is day 1 of a 180 day [meditation](../currentmeditation) on songs that defined my youth, specifically those songs associated with time spent in the little country community called Short Creek. The study for the day is "Wildwood Flower."

## The Song
"Wildwood Flower" is a folk song, No. 757 in the Roud Folk Song Index, and a variant of "I'll Twine 'Mid the Ringlets" (1860, J P Webster). Maud Irving wrote the lyrics.

The 1928 recording by The Carter Family showcases "Mother" Maybelle Carter's iconic "Carter Scratch" of playing the lead and rhythm parts together on a single guitar.

## The Carter Family
Formed in 1927, The Carter Family was one of the first commercial country groups.

## The Anecdote
My papaw's sister, Ollie, was married to a man named Alvin Carter. Families were often referred to by surnames... "The Sneeds", "The Carters", "The Goforths", etc. Given papaw was a song leader and his brother G. R. was the patriarch of "The Sneed Family", my naive young brain just assumed Alvin was related to A. P., Maybelle and the lot. Never thought to actually figure it out.

## The Technique
I learned my first three chords from my papaw, and the next few from his Mel Bay chord book. All first position. He played everything in G, C and D, so I played everything in G, C and D. Piano being the second most common instrument found around, I was familiar with major and minor scale intervals and quickly noticed the scale notes around those chords. A clumsy sort of Carter Scratch was just my natural way of playing, but I never *really* worked on thumb discipline.

I was able to get close today, so I think I'll keep trying to get this one note perfect as an ongoing exercise.
